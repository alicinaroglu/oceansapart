### Some notes for you
- I always preffer bootstrap in my previous works, thatswhy it takes a bit longer to understand Foundation Zurb structure and classes.
- You already said for "not perfect implementation" but i try to make similar to desktop and mobile jpg files.
- I try to use only Foundation Zurb structure and classes thatswhy i didn't add any inline css code or additional css files.
- So as you can see the link Foundation Zurb has some problems about vertical aligment with callout classes. I can make with flex and align-items but as i said before i didnt want to add any custom css code.
